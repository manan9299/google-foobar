# Google FooBar
My Google FooBar Experience and Challenges

[Google FooBar](http://foobar.withgoogle.com) is Google's secret recruiting challenge.
Google sends you an invitation on the basis of your search history and your problem solving related keyword searches.
There are basically 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges that follow a story.
